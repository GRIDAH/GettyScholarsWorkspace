# Getty Scholars’ Workspace

The Getty Scholars' Workspace is an online environment designed to support collaborative art-historical research. It provides a space and a toolset that enable research teams to examine digital surrogates of works of art and primary source materials, build a bibliography, translate and annotate texts, and exchange ideas. With the Scholars' Workspace, research and communication are consolidated into a single online location accessible from anywhere. 

The outcome of a project conducted in the Getty Scholars' Workspace might be an exhibition, a seminar, a digital or print publication, a scholarly talk, or something else entirely. While it is not designed to produce these outcomes itself, the Scholars' Workspace helps research teams to organize their materials, such as texts and images, and facilitates analysis, investigation, and communication. The workspace is designed to accommodate the multiple perspectives that are typical of humanities research.
